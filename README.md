# Data-Driven Mineral Prospectivity Mapping in the Tapajós Mineral Province

## Context  
The Tapajós Mineral Province (Amazonas–Pará) hosts a complex Paleoproterozoic magmatic arc juxtaposed onto Archean crust, comprising mafic–ultramafic intrusions, A- and I-type granites, greenstone sequences and rift-related clastic successions.  Despite abundant historic garimpos, vast tracts remain under-explored and require spatially explicit, cost-effective targeting tools.

## Aim  
To generate probabilistic and binary favourability maps for orogenic and intrusion-related gold, integrating multi-source geodata and a CatBoost classifier robust to severe class imbalance.
